        <h1>What is this all about?</h1>
        <div>
          <p>
            Since we were little kids, we used to see figures on TV screen with
            incredible super powers! <br />
            Those who can fly.. Those who can climb walls.. And those who can
            fight with bare hands <br />
            We always dreamed of gaining this superpowers to be special somehow{" "}
            <br />
            To fight crimes.. To feel special.. or perhaps just to showoff with
            what we can do.
          </p>
          <p>
            We never considered having superpowers can become a real thing as we
            grow up. <br />
            Simply.. it all depends on how you define this &quot;super
            power&quot; <br />
            our childhood superheros have their or fictional powers , they have
            their own skills <br />
            The keyword here is <span>Skills</span>
          </p>
        </div>
      </div>

      <div className="section-2">
        <h1>Where do we start?</h1>
        <div>
          <p>
            Start by recognizing your skills.. our skills are the things we are
            good at. <br />
            No matter how small the skill we think we have.. It is still counted.<br />
            It does not have to be unique.. what is important at this stage is to have it recognized. 
          </p>
        </div>
      </div>

      <div className="section-3">
        <h1>What is our mission?</h1>
        <div>
          <p>
            Once you realize what are 
            good at.. This is it <br />
            Your journey starts here.. starts with improving This skill and turn it to <span>Super Power</span> <br />
            Because with it you are going to save the world
